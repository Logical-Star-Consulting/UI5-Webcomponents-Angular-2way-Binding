# Angular Based UI5 Web Components Scoping Demo (Micro Front End)
This library was setup to demonstrate how scoping works with a micro front end.  Conceptually the same technique would also apply for a libary developed using UI5 Web Components also.  

## Dependent Application
To run this demo you will also need to run the following application 

## Angular Version
![Demo App](/assets/app.png)

## UI5 Version
![Demo App UI5](/assets/app-ui5.png)

## Angular Client Version
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.2.  To install the client run `npm install -g @angular/cli@14.2.2`.

## NodeJS Version
This project was developed and tested using NodeJS version 14.21.1

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
