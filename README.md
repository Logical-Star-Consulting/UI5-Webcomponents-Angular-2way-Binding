# Angular Based UI5 Web Components Scoping Demo 
This project was forked from project [UI5-Webcomponents-Angular-2way-Binding](https://github.com/Logical-Star-Consulting/UI5-Webcomponents-Angular-2way-Binding) and extended to demonstrate how scoping works in UI5 Web Components with Angular.  

A library was setup as part of [UI5-Webcomponents-Angular-Scoping-Lib](https://github.com/Logical-Star-Consulting/UI5-Webcomponents-Angular-Scoping-Lib), which incorporates components at a lower version of web components to that used in this project (which is based on v 1.9.1) to demonstrate how scoping works.  

The generated library is already part of the project, but the source code can be accessed independently.
